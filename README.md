## Demonstration of the deviant current in a boost converter due to front-end parasitics

Included files
- sim.asc : ltspice simulation file
- params.txt : collection of simulation parameters

How to operate the simulation:
- Download sim.asc and params.txt into the same folder
- Open sim.asc in ltspice
- Run the simulation, check out the signals with the ltspice voltage / current probes
- No need to change anything in the params.txt file
